## 🤖 AI Project Build Command

```
You are an expert software engineer tasked with building the Browser Console Log Pipe project. I have provided comprehensive documentation that you must follow exactly.

**IMPORTANT: Read ALL documentation first before starting any work.**

### 📋 Available Documentation:
1. **docs/Product-PRD.md** - Product requirements and business goals
2. **docs/Technical-PRD.md** - Technical specifications and implementation details
3. **docs/Architecture-PRD.md** - System architecture and design patterns
4. **docs/Task-PRD.md** - Detailed task breakdown for AI execution
5. **docs/Security-PRD.md** - Comprehensive security requirements and threat model
6. **docs/Performance-PRD.md** - Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
7. **docs/Browser-Extensions-PRD.md** - Browser extension specifications and store requirements
8. **docs/Operations-PRD.md** - Deployment, monitoring, and operational procedures

### 🎯 Your Mission:
Build the complete Browser Console Log Pipe project following the Task PRD exactly. This includes:
- Browser client library (@console-log-pipe/client)
- Global CLI tool (console-log-pipe)
- Local server (@console-log-pipe/server)
- Complete monorepo setup with proper tooling

### 📖 Execution Instructions:

1. **START HERE:** Read the docs/Task-PRD.md completely to understand the task execution framework

2. **FOLLOW THE TASK SEQUENCE:** Execute tasks in dependency order starting with T001

3. **TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
   - Follow the mandatory 5-step workflow: Understand → Develop → Test → Git Commit → Git Push
   - Update task status when starting (🔴 → 🟡)
   - Follow the "Development Workflow" section exactly
   - Write unit tests with >90% coverage
   - Commit and push ALL changes with descriptive messages
   - Test using "Verification Steps"
   - Update status when complete (🟡 → 🟢 → ✅)
   - Document progress in "Notes" section

4. **QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Follow all acceptance criteria
   - Implement exactly as specified in Technical PRD
   - Maintain architecture patterns from Architecture PRD
   - Meet all requirements from Product PRD

5. **REPOSITORY INFORMATION:**
   - Repository: https://github.com/kgptapps/consolelogpipe
   - Publisher: kgptapps
   - License: MIT

### 🚨 Critical Rules:
- **NEVER skip verification steps** - test everything thoroughly
- **NEVER deviate from the specifications** - follow docs exactly
- **ALWAYS follow the 5-step workflow** - Understand → Develop → Test → Git Commit → Git Push
- **ALWAYS write unit tests** - implement tests alongside code, not after
- **ALWAYS achieve >90% coverage** - use coverage reports to verify quality
- **ALWAYS commit and push changes** - use exact commit messages provided
- **ALWAYS run tests** before marking tasks as completed
- **ALWAYS update task status** in docs/Task-PRD.md as you progress
- **ALWAYS check dependencies** before starting a task
- **DOCUMENT everything** in the Notes sections

### 🎯 Success Criteria:
- All 29 tasks in docs/Task-PRD.md marked as ✅ VERIFIED
- Complete working system with client library, CLI tool, and server
- **>90% test coverage across all packages**
- **All unit tests passing consistently**
- **Integration tests covering main workflows**
- **Security audit completed with no critical vulnerabilities**
- **Performance benchmarks meeting all targets**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance**
- **Browser extensions working across all target browsers**
- **Production infrastructure deployed and monitored**
- All packages ready for NPM publishing
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- All verification steps passing

### 📝 Progress Reporting:
Update me on progress by showing:
- Current task being worked on
- Tasks completed and verified
- Any issues encountered
- Next steps planned

### 🚀 Start Command:
Begin with Task T001 (Repository Structure Setup) and work through the complete task list. Show me the updated docs/Task-PRD.md status after completing each task.

**Ready to build an amazing developer tool? Let's go! 🔥**

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### For AI Tools:

1. **Copy the full prompt** above and paste it to your AI tool
2. **Ensure the AI has access** to all documentation files in the docs/ folder
3. **Monitor progress** by requesting Task-PRD.md updates after each task
4. **Quality check** by reviewing verification steps and acceptance criteria

### For Pause/Resume:

- **To Pause:** Ask AI to update current task status to ⏸️ PAUSED with progress notes
- **To Resume:** Use the same prompt with a new AI tool - it will pick up where left off
- **To Check Status:** Ask for current Task-PRD.md status summary

### For Quality Assurance:

- **Verify each task** meets all acceptance criteria before proceeding
- **Test thoroughly** using the provided verification steps
- **Review code quality** against Technical and Architecture PRDs
- **Ensure documentation** is complete and accurate

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If AI Gets Stuck:

1. **Check dependencies** - ensure all prerequisite tasks are ✅ VERIFIED
2. **Review specifications** - refer back to Technical and Architecture PRDs
3. **Break down further** - split complex tasks into smaller steps
4. **Ask for clarification** - request specific guidance on unclear requirements

### If Tasks Fail:

1. **Mark as ❌ FAILED** with detailed error description in Notes
2. **Analyze the issue** - check logs, error messages, test results
3. **Fix the problem** - address root cause before retrying
4. **Reset to 🔴 NOT_STARTED** and retry with corrected approach

### If Quality Issues:

1. **Review acceptance criteria** - ensure all requirements met
2. **Run verification steps** - complete all testing procedures
3. **Check against PRDs** - verify alignment with specifications
4. **Refactor if needed** - improve code quality before marking verified
