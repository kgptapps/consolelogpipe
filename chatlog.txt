Perfect! I've successfully initialized a new Git repository in the consolelogpipe directory. The repository is now ready for you to start tracking your files.
You can now:
Add files to the repository with git add <filename> or git add . to add all files
Make your first commit with git commit -m "Initial commit"
Set up a remote repository if needed with git remote add origin <repository-url>
Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps, such as adding existing files to the repository or creating an initial commit?

Create Product PRD, Technical PRD and Architecture PRD for this project below.  ## Detailed Technical and Architectural Plan for Browser Console Log Pipe

### Objectives

* Simplify feedback loop from browsers during UI app development.
* Provide developers with real-time log streaming from browser applications.
* Support local and hosted log storage.

### High-Level Architecture

* **Client-side (Browser)** → **Real-time Log Transmission (via HTTP/WebSocket/SSE)** → **Local CLI/Server or Hosted Log Service** → **Developer Console/Log Storage**

### Technical Components

#### 1. Client-Side Library (NPM Package)

* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Functionality:**

  * Intercept and capture:

    * Console logs (`console.log`, `console.error`, etc.).
    * Unhandled exceptions (`window.onerror`, `window.onunhandledrejection`).
    * Network requests and responses (optional via native `fetch` interception).
  * Transmit logs securely and asynchronously using native `fetch` API.
  * Configurable endpoints for local or hosted log service.
  * No external dependencies.
  * Lightweight (<10KB minified).
* **Security Measures:** Regular security scans and continuous dependency auditing.

#### 2. CLI Tool

* **Language/Runtime:** Node.js (latest stable)
* **Packaging:**

  * Cross-platform binaries generated using tools like `pkg`.
  * Lightweight Docker container based on Alpine Linux.
* **Functionality:**

  * Establish WebSocket/SSE connections to receive real-time log streams.
  * Pipe received logs directly to developer's terminal.
  * Provide simple configuration via CLI flags or environment variables.
* **Security Measures:** Minimal dependencies; dependency vulnerability checks during builds.

#### 3. Local Server

* **Language/Runtime:** Node.js with native HTTP server modules.
* **Storage:** Temporary log storage in-memory or optionally on local filesystem.
* **Functionality:**

  * Receive log data via secure HTTP endpoints.
  * Real-time log streaming via WebSocket or SSE.
  * API endpoints for querying stored logs.
  * Lightweight HTTP REST API for log management.
* **Security Measures:** CORS, rate-limiting, authentication mechanisms (JWT or basic auth).

#### 4. Hosted Log Service (Optional)

* **Infrastructure:** Cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable deployment.
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express (minimal setup), Redis for temporary fast-access log storage.
* **Data Management:**

  * Logs stored temporarily (up to 1 hour).
  * Automatic deletion based on TTL policies.
* **Communication:** WebSockets/SSE for real-time log streaming.
* **Authentication:** Secure API key management or OAuth integration.
* **Monitoring and Alerts:** Built-in monitoring for reliability and performance.

### Communication Protocols and Standards

* **Data Format:** JSON payloads for structured log information.
* **Transport Protocols:** HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, SSE.
* **Security:** TLS encryption mandatory for hosted service.

### Open Source Strategy

* Fully open-source all components (Client-side library, CLI, Local server).
* Clear documentation and contribution guidelines.
* Foster active community through issue tracking and regular updates.

### Deployment and Continuous Integration

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD for automated tests, security scans, and builds.
* **Versioning and Releases:** Semantic versioning; automated package deployments to NPM and Docker Hub.

### Marketing and Growth

* **Developer Outreach:** GitHub, Reddit, Stack Overflow.
* **Content Marketing:** Tutorials, comprehensive documentation, example applications.
* **Social Media:** Regular updates and community engagement.
* **Partnerships:** Collaborate with existing popular UI frameworks.

### Initial Investment and Cost Consideration

* Minimal costs related to cloud infrastructure for the optional hosted service.
* Marketing and promotional activities.
* Engineering effort and ongoing maintenance.

### Risk Mitigation

* Regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
* Automated testing and error handling.
* Minimize dependency usage to reduce risk exposure.

This comprehensive and secure technical architecture positions Browser Console Log Pipe as an efficient and essential tool for developers, significantly improving the debugging and feedback cycle in browser-based application development.

Perfect! I've successfully updated all three PRD documents to reflect that network request capture is now a core feature enabled by default, with the option to disable it if needed. Here's a summary of the changes made:
🔄 Changes Made:
Product PRD Updates:
✅ Moved network request/response capture from "Should Have" to "Must Have (MVP)"
✅ Added it as a core feature in the client library requirements
✅ Moved advanced request/response body capture to "Should Have" as optional enhancement
Technical PRD Updates:
✅ Updated core functionality to include "fetch/XMLHttpRequest interception (enabled by default)"
✅ Added comprehensive Network Capture Configuration section with:
Default enabled state with disable option
Header capture (enabled by default)
Body capture (disabled by default for privacy/performance)
URL exclusion patterns
Header sanitization for security
Configurable size limits
✅ Updated API design example to show network configuration options
✅ Added network capture performance requirements
Architecture PRD Updates:
✅ Updated the system architecture diagram to show network capture as a core component
✅ Reflected network monitoring as an integral part of the log capture flow
🎯 Key Benefits of This Change:
Complete Debugging Picture: Developers get both console logs AND network activity by default
Privacy-First: Request/response bodies are disabled by default, only headers captured
Configurable: Easy to disable entirely or customize what gets captured
Performance-Conscious: Optimized defaults that don't impact application performance
Security-Aware: Built-in sanitization of sensitive headers like authorization tokens
The network capture feature is now positioned as a core differentiator that provides developers with comprehensive debugging information right out of the box, while maintaining strong privacy and performance characteristics.
