## Executive Summary

Browser Console Log Pipe is a developer tool that simplifies the feedback loop during UI application
development by providing real-time log streaming from browser applications to developer
environments. The solution addresses the common pain point of debugging browser applications where
developers need to constantly switch between browser dev tools and their development environment.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

- **Context Switching:** Developers constantly switch between browser dev tools and their
  IDE/terminal
- **Log Persistence:** Browser console logs are lost on page refresh or navigation
- **Remote Debugging:** Difficult to debug applications running on different devices or environments
- **Team Collaboration:** Hard to share browser logs with team members for debugging
- **CI/CD Integration:** No easy way to capture browser logs during automated testing
- **Multi-Application Chaos:** Developers working on multiple applications simultaneously cannot
  isolate logs per application
- **AI Development Friction:** Logs are not structured for AI tools to easily parse and analyze
- **Session Tracking:** No way to track specific user sessions or development contexts across
  applications

### Target Users

- **Primary:** Frontend developers working on multiple web applications simultaneously
- **Secondary:** AI developers building tools that need structured browser log data
- **Tertiary:** QA engineers testing web applications across different environments
- **Quaternary:** DevOps engineers setting up monitoring for web applications

## Product Vision

To become the standard tool for real-time browser log streaming, enabling developers to seamlessly
integrate browser debugging into their existing development workflow.

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Reduce Development Friction:** Eliminate the need to constantly check browser dev tools
2. **Improve Debugging Efficiency:** Provide persistent, searchable log history
3. **Enable Remote Debugging:** Support debugging applications on any device/environment
4. **Foster Collaboration:** Make it easy to share logs with team members

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** 10,000+ NPM downloads within 6 months
- **Engagement:** 70% of users continue using after first week
- **Performance:** <100ms latency for log transmission
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for hosted service

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic Log Streaming

- **As a** frontend developer, **I want to** install a global CLI tool **so that** I can use it
  across all my projects
- **As a** developer, **I want to** see a session ID when I start the server **so that** I know how
  to connect my app
- **As a** frontend developer, **I want to** see browser console logs in my terminal **so that** I
  don't have to switch between browser and IDE
- **As a** developer, **I want to** capture unhandled errors **so that** I can debug production
  issues
- **As a** developer, **I want to** filter logs by level **so that** I can focus on relevant
  information

### Epic 2: Advanced Features

- **As a** developer, **I want to** persist logs locally **so that** I can review them later
- **As a** team lead, **I want to** share log streams with team members **so that** we can
  collaborate on debugging
- **As a** QA engineer, **I want to** capture logs during automated tests **so that** I can debug
  test failures

### Epic 3: Multi-Application Monitoring

- **As a** developer working on 5 different applications, **I want to** monitor each application
  separately **so that** logs don't get mixed up
- **As a** developer, **I want to** auto-generated session IDs logged to console **so that** I can
  manually inspect specific sessions when needed
- **As an** AI developer, **I want to** structured log data with error categorization **so that** my
  tools can intelligently analyze application behavior
- **As a** developer, **I want to** application-specific server instances **so that** each
  application has isolated monitoring
- **As a** developer, **I want to** smart event routing **so that** no events are sent when no one
  is listening

### Epic 4: Integration & Deployment

- **As a** developer, **I want to** integrate with my existing build tools **so that** setup is
  minimal
- **As a** DevOps engineer, **I want to** deploy a self-hosted version **so that** we maintain data
  privacy
- **As a** developer, **I want to** use a hosted service **so that** I don't need to manage
  infrastructure
